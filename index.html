    <h3 class="Noraml"> The best method of "imaginary practice" is to watch an expert do something and predict what they're gonna do next. Funnily enough, I learned this method from a rank 1 Teamfight Tactics player. Their advice was to download the VODs of the best players, turn the audio off, and constantly pause the gameplay trying to accurately predict all of that players decisions. When you're incorrect, you take time to think about why they did something different. 
Similarly, when I got trained on my current job I was able to learn the job way faster than anyone had ever learned it because I poured every ounce of my focus into watching them closely and trying to predict in my mind every move they were gonna make. This is also how I train people at the job, I have them watch me for a bit but then I have them tell me what my next action is every step of the way. You can technically get someone up to speed faster by letting them learn hands on, but I operate heavy industrial machinery that can injure people and cause thousands in damages very quickly if you don't know what you're doing.</h3>
